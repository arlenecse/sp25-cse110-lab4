1. Line 12 prints 3, which is the number of prices in the list, because it returns the value of i after iterating through the list three times.
2. Line 13 prints 150, which is the last price in the list (300) multiplied by (1 - discount) so 300 * 0.50 is 150 since it would have the value of the last iteration.
3. Line 14 prints 150 because it is the final price calculated at the last iteration with the value of discountedPrice.
4. The function will return the array [50, 100, 150], which are the rounded discounted prices calculated in the for loop for the input price and discount. Nothing gets printed because it is a return function.
5. Line 12 causes ReferenceError: i is not defined because i is only defined in the scope of the for loop and therefore cannot be accessed outside the loop.
6. Line 13 causes ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined because the variable discountedPrice is only defined in the scope of the for loop and therefore cannot be accessed outside the loop.
7. Line 14 prints out 150 because the variable finalPrice is defined in the same block as the print statement.
8. The function will return the array [50, 100, 150] because discounted is in the scope of the function and will return the discounted prices calculated in the for loop.
9. Line 11 causes ReferenceError: i is not defined because i is only accessible in the for loop block.
10. Line 12 prints 3 because the length is the number of elements in the input list prices.
11. The function will return the array [50, 100, 150] because you can modify a const but not reassign a const.
